# HFSZEEMAN95

This is an updated and extended Fortran 95 version of the Hfszeeman program [Comput. Phys. Commun. 178 (2008) 156170]. The extension and updates includes:

1. the translation of HFSZEEMAN from F77 to F95 to adapt it to Grasp2018
2. modification of rtransition in grasp2k to print out the phase factor
3. matlab routine to compute transition rates between different magnetic fine- and hyperfine structure substates in the presence of an external magnetic field and rates of hyperfine-induced transitions in the field free limit
4. the synthesization of spectral profiles for transitions obtained from 3
