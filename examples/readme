There are six tests included in the example folder, they are:

Test 1, computing and plotting the Zeeman splittings of magnetic hyperfine structure substates of 
$1s2p~^{1,3}P$ in $^3$He. 

Test 2, computing and plotting the Zeeman splittings of magnetic fine structure substates of 
$1s4f~^{1,3}F$ and $1s5f~^{1,3}F$ in $^4$He. 

Test 3, computing and plotting the Zeeman splittings of magnetic fine structure substates of 
$1s^24d~^2D$ in $^6$Li. 

Test 4, computing hyperfine-induced-transitions in the He-like $^{19}F$.

Test 5, computing magnetic-field-induced transitions for the Be-like $^{47}Ti$ and $^{48}Ti$ 

Test 6, generation of synthetic spectra for the hyperfine $4s4d~^3D_2 - 4s4f~^3F_{2,3}$ transition array in Ga II.  

Preparatory calculations using the programs of Grasp2018 have to be done in order to perform the test runs, 
and the corresponding scripts and session log are located in each test folder.
